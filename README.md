# Bio
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Sunwoo "Andy" Jang, a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science @ IUPUI.
I've been building small websites, bots, and applications for almost 6 years and have fallen in love with coding!

I'm most proficient in C++, Python, and JavaScript, but also am familiar with other languages as well.
I've really been enjoying doing front-end work as of recently, working with React.js, Tailwind, and MUI X just to name a few.

Always going above and beyond people's expectations brings me so much joy and I hope to continue this trend throughout my career.
Never skipping a line of code and a meticulous attitude towards programming has given me great success in the small projects I've made.

# Projects
* JonfBot: a bot made using Discord.py to get random quotes and images from an API.
* Minecraft Potion Brewer: a webapp that simulates Minecraft potion brewing using the Bottle.py framework.
* CSCI-N341 Course Page: A page containing subprojects that use HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery for user interactivity.
* N-Queens: a text-based C++ implementation of the N-Queens problem using a stack and associated logic.
* Stock Span: a C++ implementation of the stock span problem comparing a brute force approach to a stack approach.
