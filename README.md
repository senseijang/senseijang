# Bio
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sunwoo "Andy" Jang, a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science @ IUPUI.
I've been building small websites, bots, and applications for almost 6 years and have fallen in love with coding!

I'm most proficient in C++, Python, and JavaScript, but also am familiar with other languages as well.
Always going above and beyond people's expectations brings me so much joy and I hope to continue this trend throughout my career.
Never skipping a line of code and a meticulous attitude towards programming has given me great success in the small projects I've made.

Relevant Coursework: Discrete Math, Calculus I & II, Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms  
Spring '23: Architecture of Computers, Mechanics, Principles of Software Design
# Projects
* [JonfBot](https://github.com/senseijang/jonfBot): a bot made using Discord.py to get random quotes and images from an API.
* [Minecraft Potion Brewer](https://github.com/senseijang/minecraftPotionBrew): a webapp that simulates Minecraft potion brewing using the Bottle.py framework.
