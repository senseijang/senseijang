# Bio
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sunwoo "Andy" Jang, a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science @ IUPUI.
I've been building small websites, bots, and applications for almost 6 years and have fallen in love with coding!

I'm most proficient in C++, Python, and JavaScript, but also am familiar with other languages as well.
I've really been enjoying doing front-end work as of recently, working with React.js, Tailwind, and MUI X just to name a few.

Always going above and beyond people's expectations brings me so much joy and I hope to continue this trend throughout my career.
Never skipping a line of code and a meticulous attitude towards programming has given me great success in the small projects I've made.
